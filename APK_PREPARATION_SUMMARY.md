## Test Results Summary

### Core Application Tests
- **Total Tests**: 116
- **Passed**: 110 (95%)

2. `ExportDataAsync_WithSampleData_ExportsAllEntities`
3. `ValidateBackupDataAsync_WithInvalidWorkout_ReturnsErrors`
4. `ValidateBackupDataAsync_WithBrokenForeignKeys_ReturnsErrors`
5. `ImportDataAsync_WithValidData_ImportsSuccessfully`
6. `ImportDataAsync_WithOverwriteTrue_ReplacesExistingData`

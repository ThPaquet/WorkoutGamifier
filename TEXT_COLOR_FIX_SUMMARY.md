# Text Color Visibility Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
**Problem**: Workout names and pool names were appearing as invisible white text on white backgrounds, making them unreadable.

## Root Cause
Several key labels in the workout pool UI were missing explicit `TextColor` properties, causing them to inherit the default text color (which could be white) while being displayed on white backgrounds.

## Files Fixed

### 1. WorkoutPoolDetailPage.xaml
**Issue**: Workout name labels were invisible
```xml
<!-- BEFORE (invisible text) -->
<Label Text="{Binding Name}" 
       FontSize="18" 
       FontAttributes="Bold" />

<!-- AFTER (visible black text) -->
<Label Text="{Binding Name}" 
       FontSize="18" 
       FontAttributes="Bold" 
       TextColor="Black" />
```

### 2. WorkoutSelectionPage.xaml
**Issue**: Workout name labels in selection list were invisible
```xml
<!-- BEFORE (invisible text) -->
<Label Text="{Binding Name}" 
       FontSize="16" 
       FontAttributes="Bold" />

<!-- AFTER (visible black text) -->
<Label Text="{Binding Name}" 
       FontSize="16" 
       FontAttributes="Bold" 
       TextColor="Black" />
```

### 3. WorkoutPoolsPage.xaml
**Issue**: Pool name labels were invisible
```xml
<!-- BEFORE (invisible text) -->
<Label Text="{Binding Name}" 
       FontSize="20" 
       FontAttributes="Bold" />

<!-- AFTER (visible black text) -->
<Label Text="{Binding Name}" 
       FontSize="20" 
       FontAttributes="Bold" 
       TextColor="Black" />
```

## Why This Happened

1. **White Backgrounds**: All workout/pool cards use `BackgroundColor="White"`
2. **Missing Text Colors**: Primary labels didn't have explicit `TextColor` properties
3. **Theme Inheritance**: Labels inherited default text color from system theme
4. **Light Theme Issue**: In light themes, default text color can be white, causing white-on-white invisibility

## What's Now Visible

âœ… **Workout names** in pool detail view
âœ… **Workout names** in workout selection list  
âœ… **Pool names** in pools list
âœ… **All primary labels** now have explicit black text color

## Other Labels Already Fixed

These labels already had proper text colors and were visible:
- Description text (`TextColor="Gray"` or `TextColor="DarkGray"`)
- Difficulty and duration labels (`TextColor="Gray"`)
- Status indicators (had background colors with white text)
- Empty state messages (`TextColor="Gray"`)

## Build Status

âœ… **Android build successful** - All changes compile correctly
âœ… **No breaking changes** - Only added `TextColor="Black"` properties
âœ… **Backward compatible** - Explicit colors work on all themes

## Expected Results

After this fix:
1. **Workout names should be clearly visible** in all pool-related screens
2. **Pool names should be readable** in the pools list
3. **Text should remain visible** regardless of system theme
4. **No more white-on-white invisibility issues**

The workout pool functionality should now be fully usable with all text clearly visible! ðŸŽ¯

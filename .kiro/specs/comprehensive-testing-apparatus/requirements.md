# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive testing apparatus for the WorkoutGamifier MAUI application. The goal is to create an extremely regression-resistant testing framework that includes automated UI testing with Appium, enhanced unit/integration testing, and automated issue detection to minimize manual testing overhead while ensuring high application quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated UI testing with Appium so that I can catch UI regressions and user workflow issues without manual testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL execute Appium-based UI tests on Android devices/emulators
2. WHEN UI tests run THEN the system SHALL test critical user workflows including workout creation, session management, and pool operations
3. WHEN UI tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with screenshots for failed tests
4. IF a UI test fails THEN the system SHALL capture device logs and application state for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced unit and integration test coverage so that I can detect business logic issues before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 90% code coverage across all business logic
2. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive edge case testing for all services
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL test complete user workflows from UI to database
4. IF any test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information with stack traces and context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated performance testing so that I can detect performance regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN the system SHALL measure app startup time, page navigation speed, and database operation performance
2. WHEN performance benchmarks are exceeded THEN the system SHALL fail the test and report the performance degradation
3. WHEN performance tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate performance trend reports
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL identify the specific operations causing slowdowns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated accessibility testing so that the app remains accessible to all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessibility tests run THEN the system SHALL verify proper semantic labels, contrast ratios, and navigation patterns
2. WHEN accessibility violations are found THEN the system SHALL report specific elements and suggested fixes
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate accessibility compliance reports
4. IF critical accessibility issues exist THEN the system SHALL fail the build process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want continuous integration testing so that every code change is automatically validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger the complete test suite
2. WHEN tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL execute on multiple device configurations and OS versions
3. WHEN CI tests complete THEN the system SHALL publish test results and coverage reports
4. IF any critical tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent code deployment and notify developers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visual regression testing so that UI changes don't break the visual design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visual tests run THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots of key app screens
2. WHEN screenshots are compared THEN the system SHALL detect visual differences from baseline images
3. WHEN visual changes are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific differences
4. IF visual regressions exceed threshold THEN the system SHALL fail the test and require manual review

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database integrity testing so that data corruption issues are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database tests run THEN the system SHALL verify data consistency, foreign key constraints, and migration integrity
2. WHEN data operations execute THEN the system SHALL validate that all CRUD operations maintain referential integrity
3. WHEN database schema changes THEN the system SHALL verify backward compatibility and migration success
4. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL report the specific integrity violations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test maintenance so that the test suite remains reliable with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI elements change THEN the system SHALL automatically update element selectors where possible
2. WHEN test data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL refresh test datasets automatically
3. WHEN tests become flaky THEN the system SHALL identify and report unstable tests for review
4. IF test infrastructure fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information for quick resolution
